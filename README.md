rust-jack
=========

This is a wrapper in rust around the c api for
[Jack](http://jackaudio.org/).  It includes some example clients in
the bin directory.

The Jack api can be found
[here](http://jackaudio.org/files/docs/html/index.html).

At some point there will be a proper api doc for this rust library as
well.

Building
--------
to build simply do

    cargo build
